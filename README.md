# # Times Pan Demo


## What's Times Pan?
Times Pan is a commercial mobile game owned by honeygrow, to be hosted on their native app.
This repo shows off my contributions to this project via video and screenshots in order to maintain respect to honeygrow's property.

## Contributions
I came into this project with the game having nine levels already completed. My additions to the game have been:
* A new level centered around the Midtown New York honeygrow locations
    * All using the same assets as the last nine levels
* Created a "Split Level" module to differ from the kitchen sink module.
 
This repo shows off all of these two changes
